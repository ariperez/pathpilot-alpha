# **PathPilot: The Pathology & Lab Intelligence Companion**

---

## **1\. Why? (Problem Statement)**

* **70% of EHR data is pathology/lab data** ‚Üí yet it‚Äôs fragmented, unstructured, and poorly surfaced.

* **Clinician overload**: Lab data arrives piecemeal, across the day, requiring constant interruptions for interpretation and potential action.

* **No holistic view**: Current EHR interfaces emphasize transaction (individual result display) rather than trend interpretation or prioritization.

* **Patient safety & workflow risk**: Missed results, delayed recognition of trends, and ‚Äúnote bloat‚Äù without true insight.

---

## **2\. What PathPilot Does (Core Features)**

**Unified Lab Dashboard**

* Aggregates **all historical labs** (pathology, hematology, chemistry, genetics, etc.) into one normalized, structured dataset.

* **Trend plotting** across time with intuitive visualization (delta change alerts, baseline overlays, critical thresholds).

* **AI-powered triage**: Surfaces the *most relevant and actionable labs* for a given patient encounter.

**Interpretation & Execution Layer**

* Provides a **holistic summary** of lab context for the clinician‚Äîavoiding ‚Äúdata dump‚Äù fatigue.

* Suggests **interpretation assistance** (guidelines, evidence-based ranges, contextual links).

* Enables **in-app ordering & follow-up** (labs, consults, meds) without leaving the dashboard.

**Analytics & Insight Discovery**

* Detects **underlying patterns** across lab domains (e.g., rising inflammatory markers \+ abnormal liver enzymes ‚Üí potential drug toxicity).

* Surfaces **predictive insights** (progression risk, therapy response, organ decline).

* Integrates into **population health dashboards** for proactive care management.

---

## **3\. Additional Features**

* **Personalized Lab Narratives**: Patient-friendly explanations, translated into multiple languages.

* **Critical Lab Escalation**: Smart routing of urgent results with configurable alert fatigue management.

* **Composite Biomarker Panels**: Auto-calculates risk scores (MELD, KDIGO, ASCVD).

* **Predictive Deterioration Models**: Lab \+ vitals \+ imaging \= early warning of deterioration.

* **Auto-Order Suggestions**: ‚ÄúConsider ordering iron studies to complete anemia work-up.‚Äù

* **Longitudinal Cohort Analytics**: Create cohorts for real-world evidence, trial eligibility, and population health.

---

## **4\. How Else It Could Be Used (Expanded Use Cases)**

**Upskill Nurses & Medics**

* Interpretation ‚Äúco-pilot‚Äù allows non-MD providers to safely handle more lab-related tasks.

* Structured explanations build clinical confidence.

**Shift Handoff Support**

* Labs & actions queued ‚Üí next provider inherits a curated **to-do list** with trend context.

* Reduces handoff errors (a major patient safety risk).

**Patient Empowerment (B2C Add-On)**

* Patient-facing **Lab Coach** with simplified trends, plain language, and context in the portal.

* Reduces anxiety and unnecessary calls/messages.

**Pharmacy Integration**

* Tie labs to medication monitoring (e.g., INR for warfarin, creatinine for metformin).

* Support pharmacist-driven therapy adjustments.

**Occupational / Military / Space Health**

* Remote medics use PathPilot to interpret labs without a pathologist onsite.

* Action queueing critical in shift-based or mission-critical environments.

**Global Health / Emerging Markets**

* Lightweight mode for low-bandwidth settings.

* Surfaces **high-yield, high-risk labs** first (HIV viral load, TB, malaria).

**Quality & Compliance**

* Automated audit logs ensure abnormal labs are acknowledged.

* Supports Joint Commission & CMS reporting.

**Revenue Cycle / CDI Integration**

* Suggests ICD-10 coding implications from lab clusters.

* Ensures complete documentation for billing.

---

## **5\. Strategic Fit with Oracle Health**

* **Leverages Oracle‚Äôs semantic database \+ knowledge graph** for structured interpretation.

* **AI-in-Flow of Work**: Native embedding into clinician workflow \= no context switching.

* **Differentiator vs. Epic**:

  * Epic \= static, fragmented, old-data models.

  * PathPilot \= real-time, predictive, actionable intelligence.

---

## **6\. Business Opportunity**

**Primary Buyers**

* Health systems deploying Oracle Health EHR (large IDNs, VA, DoD).

* Biopharma companies (lab-heavy trials, safety monitoring).

* Public health and global health organizations.

**Value Proposition**

* Saves **physician time** ‚Üí reduced burnout.

* Improves **patient safety** ‚Üí early detection, fewer missed labs.

* Reduces **handoff errors** ‚Üí safer transitions of care.

* Creates **new revenue streams** ‚Üí premium module, AI subscription, research data licensing.

---

## **7\. Differentiating Edge**

* **All labs, all time**: Longitudinal intelligence layer, not just snapshots.

* **Action layer**: Interpretation \+ execution, not just visualization.

* **Upskilling function**: Empowers nurses, medics, and pharmacists.

* **Global scalability**: Adaptable to low-resource settings.

* **Regulatory & billing alignment**: Improves compliance and reimbursement.

---

## **8\. Commercial Angles**

* **Diagnostics company partnerships** (Roche, Abbott, Illumina) for proprietary algorithms.

* **Biopharma companion app**: Lab monitoring for clinical trials.

* **Precision medicine expansion**: Integrate genomics/molecular pathology.

* **AI training data**: Anonymized lab trends \= high-value dataset for pharma/AI research.

**Pitch deck for pathpilot:**

‚Äã‚ÄãPerfect ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **VA-specific PathPilot pitch deck outline** tied directly to the congressional hearing pain points:

---

# **PathPilot: AI-Powered Lab Intelligence for VA Healthcare**

---

## **Slide 1 ‚Äî Title & Hook**

**‚ÄúFrom Lab Chaos to Clinical Clarity: Unifying Veteran Health Data‚Äù**

* Visual: fractured lab reports consolidating into a single clean dashboard.

* Tagline: *Helping VA clinicians see what matters, when it matters.*

---

## **Slide 2 ‚Äî The VA‚Äôs Current Problem (Voiced in Congress)**

* **172 VA facilities \= 172 silos** ‚Äî fragmented lab & pathology data.

* **$16B already spent** trying to unify EHRs with limited success.

* **Clinician burden**: juggling multiple lab systems, missing trends, delayed interventions.

* **Congressional warning**: ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt afford vendors who leech VA data without improving outcomes.‚Äù
